# KLJP 18/2 - Offensive Images of Doges

## Case Summary

General Information | Case 18/2 
--- | ---
Court | General
Jurors | 7
Date | August 7th, 2018

## Facts
A user has submitted an image showing a cartoon doge lying on the ground with a blindfold on. A hand is performing sexually
explicit actions on the doge.

It was challenged by a prosecutor and went to trial. The first jury unanimously decided that the disputed image shall be
rejected. This decision was appealed, however and went to a jury of seven jurors.

## Decision
Just like the inferior court the jurors unanimously decided that the explicit image shall not become a part of the curated
list.

## Implications
Even though, there is no explicit rule stating that offensive images shall be rejected the majority of jurors seems to believe
that inappropriate pictures shall not become part of the curated list. The legal basis for this opinion is still unclear. It
can either be due to the moral law being perceived as part of the body of laws that shall be applied in Kleros cases or
because the declared intention of the Doges on Trial pilot is to create a collection of doge memes - something that
pornographic or otherwise inappropriate images do not qualify as.

Even though both decision have been made unanimously the case is subject to discussion among the members of the Kleros
community. Therefore, it could be that the decision will be overruled some time in the future.
