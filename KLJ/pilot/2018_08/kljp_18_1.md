# KLJP 18/1 - Dogs not being Shiba Inu

## Case Summary

General Information | Case P 18/1 
--- | ---
Court | General
Jurors | 3
Date | August 5th, 2018

**Dogs other than Shiba Inu are not considered to be doges.**

## Facts
A user has submitted a gif showing Homer from the Simpsons vanishing into a dog. In the background there is another such dog. 
The image has been challenged by a prosecutor who claims that the dogs in the picture are clearly no Shiba Inu and therefore
do not qualify as doges.

## Decision
The majority of jurors have rejected the image and therefore decided in favor of the prosecution. Due to the technical
limitations of the pilot there was no way for them to justify their verdict on the platform.

## Implications
The decision probably defined the meaning of "doge" for the first time during the pilot. A picture that show another dog than 
a Shiba Inu will  likely be rejected in future decisions as well.
