# KLJ Reports
## Directory Structure
This directory contains all reported cases. There is a sub directory for every month (e. g. "2018_07" for July 2018). In those 
directories every case gets its own markdown file.

The cases are numbered chronologically every year. So the case "KLJ 3/18" is the third case reported in the year 2018 and
the case "KLJ 490/19" is the 490th case reported in 2019. The file names have to match the case number. For example the file
of the first case mentioned would be "KLJ_3_18.md". The month in which a case is decided does not affect its case number.

## Report files
Every report begins with a heading. This heading has to contain the case number and may contain a heading that briefly
describes the case. This heading can also be reffered to as "case name" Therefore the first line of each case file should look as follows:

```markdown
# KLJ XX/YY - Case Name
```
