# How to contribute?
There are several ways you can contribute to the Kleros Law Journal. The first step is to help determining the structure of
this repository and thinking of guidelines regarding the layout of case reports. This has to be done when the first rulings
are publicly available.

## Reporting Cases
When you spot a case that you believe to be important for future decisions you can either create an issue so experienced case
reporters can cover it in the journal or you can create a report yourself. The way you can report a case is still to be
determined and will be explained in this document once the first cases have been decided.

## Explaining policies
We aim on maintaining an overview of the Kleros policies together with comments explaining them and refering to decisions 
relating to them. You can help keeping them up to date by checking whether the policies have changed, new decisions regarding
a policy have been made or simply by giving your opinion on the policies and discussing it in a pull request.

## Help giving this repository a structure
The Law Journal will hopefully grow big soon. However, we are not sure yet how to structure the repo so you can easily find
the decisions you need or the policies you want to look up. Therefore, we are grateful for every proposal regarding the
organization of this repo and everybody who helps defining guidelines regarding the Case Reports and the policy coverage.
