# The Kleros Law Journal
An Open Collection of Kleros Cases

## The Law of Kleros
Blockchain technology has brought enormous change to the requirements dispute resolution mechanisms have to meet. Kleros - a decentralized on chain arbitration solution - tries to meet those requirements. Kleros uses randomly selected anonymous jurors who are presented the facts of a dispute that has arised in the Ethereum eco-system and then vote on a ruling that will be auto-enforced by a smart contract. As the jurors do not interact with each other every single one of them has to decide on their own what the law is and vote according to their belief.

In most cases one can determine which party of the dispute is right and which is wrong. However, it is very likely that there will be more difficult cases sometimes in which there can be many views on what is the law. When jurors face such a case they cannot just trust there intuition and their sense of justice but need to use tools to evaluate the case and determine what is the correct ruling. It is in their interest to work carefully on their argumentation for their ruling in order to prevent the dispute partys from appealing as appealed decisions are not rewarded. As of now there are two ways for jurors to get information to help them decide what is the "law".

The first one is court policies. Kleros uses several sub courts which each specialize in different cases like insurance or e-commerce. Using a liquid democracy mechanism these courts can be given policies which act like statute law in conventional law systems.

The second one is previous court decisions. Once there have been the first decisions in Kleros subcourts jurors will be able to refer to previous court decisions on similiar cases to argumentatively defend their ruling. Finding appropriate past decisions, however, becomes more difficult when more cases have been decided.

## What ist The Kleros Law Journal?
Kleros Law Journal is a project that aims on helping jurors find the resources they need to properly rule on their cases. There are no judges in Kleros who spent years of their lives studying the law who instruct the jury. Furthermore, jurors usually work on cases in their free time. Therefore, it cannot be expected that every juror has the time or the knowledge to intensively research previous cases or look up court policies and interpret them properly.

For this reason Kleros Law Journal aims on gathering relevant cases and providing explainations of new policies so it can be used by the jurors to help them find the right decision. It does so by allowing everybody to report cases they think to be helpful.
